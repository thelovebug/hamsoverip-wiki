We are happy to have you here! There are other Ham Radio VOIP Services out there, but we are glad you chose to get an extension with us. One of the nice things about this system is it is a \"Bring Your Own Device\" kind of thing. We will give you your credentials and allow you to configure your phone yourself. We also allow up to 10 endpoints (different phones) on your account. Because we put the onus of phone configuration back on the user, you will need to be familiar with configuring your device. In order to get started, you will need to enter a ticket in our ticketing system. Please go to https://hamsoverip.com and click on the Enter Ticket icon and put a ticket in. This will get the process started. Some things to keep in mind: Once your extension is provisioned, you will get sent an email with your credentials. When configuration screens ask for a user name, your user name is your extension number. You can use whatever device you want, but you will need to know how to configure it. Also know that we can support alot of phones, but there are a few that we receommend to make helping the end user easier.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"General/user_guides/getting-started/#getting-started","text":"Thank you for choosing Hams Over IP!

Note that this does not enable Autopatch from the RF connection. This is a one way connection from HOIP to your RF system, basically a reverse autopatch if you will. All RF-Link Extensions will be in the format of 15XXX , 25XXX or 35000 . Creating an RF Connection \u00b6 To create a connection , you first need to have a properly configured AllStar Node. Asterisk is needed to connect to the HOIP system as the HOIP system is based on Asterisk (FreePBX is the GUI front End to Asterisk) as well. There is plenty of documentation online on configuring an Allstar Node, so that is outside the scope of this document. It is recommended, but not required, that you configure a private node on your AllStar Node when configuring the node to have the phone connection tie to. This will allow you to disconnect the phone connection from your AllStar node in case there is a problem. Also, we ask that you check to make sure your PTT command is setup to be *99 and release to be # in your rpt.conf file if you do not already have this setup. This will make sure that once someone dials in that they do not cause interference or problems on accident. This will also make all PTT commands uniform for the system. This should be already set by default, but if you made changes at some point, this may have been changed. On your Allstar Node \u00b6 You will need to edit the IAX.conf and extensions.conf files. In your iax.conf you will need to configure a stanza similar to this: [ hoipphone ] username = <Choose a username> type = user context = hhphone host = dynamic auth = md5 secret = <choose a password> disallow = all allow = ulaw allow = g726aal2 allow = gsm codecpriority = host transfer = no callerid = \"HOIP\" In your extensions.conf you need to configure a stanza similar to below. * Note : you need to change the node numbers shown below to the node that you are having the connection dial into. So, if you configured a private node and if, for example, that node number is 1999, then you would use 1999 in place of 47374 below: [ hoipphone ] exten = > 47374 ,1,answer () exten = > 47374 ,n,Playback ( rpt/node ) exten = > 47374 ,n,Playback ( digits/4 ) exten = > 47374 ,n,Playback ( digits/7 ) exten = > 47374 ,n,Playback ( digits/3 ) exten = > 47374 ,n,Playback ( digits/7 ) exten = > 47374 ,n,Playback ( digits/4 ) exten = > 47374 ,n,Playback ( rpt/connected ) exten = > 47374 ,n,rpt ( 47374 | P ) Connecting to Ham's Over IP \u00b6 Once you have your node configured, you will need to request an RF-Link Extension on the HOIP system through the HOIP ticketing system. Go to https://hamsoverip.com/ and click \"Request a Line\". If you have an account, sign in and then select Open a New Ticket . If you do not have an account, then just select Open a New Ticket . Fill out the Contact Information Part of the Ticket. Select the RF-Link Request Help Topic. Just note in the Issue Summary part that this is a request for a RF-Link You will need to make sure to include an IAX2 Dial string that includes the stanza information you setup for your node\u2019s connections in the details part of the Issue Summary box. Make sure to modify this example IAX Dial String to match your system correctly. The IAX2 Dial String is formatted like this: bash IAX2/username:password@domain:port/node number to connect to So for an example: bash IAX2/usrname:paswrd@my.node.com:4569/1999 This is the most important part. Without this, we are not able to connect to your system. Finally fill out the rest of the requested information in the RF-Link Request area. Once your extension is provisioned, you will be contacted with your extension number (which will be the next sequential number in the list) to test and make sure that you can connect to your node. Now Profit.","title":"Configure an RF Link"},{"location":"endpoints/other/rf-links/#hoip-rf-linking","text":"HOIP allows extensions to be tied to an RF connection to allow others to dial in and use the RF link.

If this is just a change request (in other words something needs to be changed or updated on the wiki), please submit it in the Wiki Chat channel on Discord. No need to format it or anything. This would be things like \"This word is mis-spelled\" or \" can you add this?\" if it is longer, like a rework of an existing document, then please put it into a Markdown Document to make updating easier. If this is a whole new item, it is asked that you make the submission using a Markdown Document. If you are not familiar with Markdown, it is a very simple way to format text files. In fact, this wiki is actually done in Markdown. Markdown makes documentation much easier as it is easier to format commands and such in a way that is familiar. A Markdown Primer can be found here . Submission \u00b6 If you are not using Github to do a pull request, to submit the file, please upload the file to the Wiki Chat channel on Discord. The person in charge of the Wiki will take it and review it. Approval Process \u00b6 Once the change has been submitted, the document will be reviewed. If more clearification is needed, it will the changes will be asked for and the updated file resubmitted. Once everything is in order, the change will be approved and the submission included in the wiki. This process is in place to make sure we have very good and complete documentation on things. It does no good to have a wiki and have things that do not work. But at the same time, if you want to make a submission, be through. Go through the process of creating the documentation.
